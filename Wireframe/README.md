# Wireframe

![Wireframe](./wireframe.png)

Using the provided wireframe and resources, write a new webpage explaining:

1. What is the purpose of a README file?
   A README file serves as the main introduction or guide to a project. Its purpose is to help others understand what the project is about.
2. What is the purpose of a wireframe?
   It's the visual guide for a website or app. The purpose is to outline the structure, layout, and functionality of a page before any design or development work begins.
3. What is a branch in Git?
   A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows you to work on different versions of a project without affecting the main codebase.
   There are some provided HTML and CSS files you can use to get started. You can use these files as a starting point or create your own files from scratch. You _must_ modify the HTML and CSS files to meet the acceptance criteria and you must check this criteria yourself before you submit your work.
